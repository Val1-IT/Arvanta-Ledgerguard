# Browser runtime

This folder runs the agent network in the visitor's browser. Copy it into each
agentified site, and do not change it there.

It is a copy of the [nsdeploy](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/nsdeploy) browser
runtime (Apache 2.0, see `LICENSE.txt`) at nsdeploy commit `23df164` (2026-11-10), with
the edits listed below.

Why it is edited. A site's page has its own functions, called actions, like a room
search. nsdeploy's runtime does not let an agent use them as tools. The agent can only
offer a button or form. The visitor must click it and, by default, confirm the action.
The agent cannot answer until the visitor writes again.

Without editing the runtime, a site can plug in its own confirmation dialog, but not
tools that run the page's functions: the runtime builds the tool list in its own code. So
the runtime is edited. nsdeploy has no issue or pull request for this, so the edits live
here.

With the edits, each action the site's settings file (`agent-manifest.json`) lists under
`agentTools` becomes a `website_<name>` tool. Look-ups and undoable changes, such as
filling in the booking form, run without asking. Only actions the site marks
`irreversible`, like a booking, wait for the visitor to confirm. The AI model cannot
change these marks.

Edited files. Each one has a line near its top saying that it was changed:

- `runner.js` offers each local-only action listed in the manifest's `actions.agentTools`
  as a `website_<name>` tool and runs it through the site's action registry. Actions with
  the `irreversible` effect ask the visitor first. It also adds a `render_cruse` tool for
  forms and tables in the chat.
- `engine.js` passes the page's confirmation dialog to `runner.js`.
- `cruse.js` accepts CRUSE replies without code fences and merges forms from several
  agents into one. It also tells agents about the `render_cruse` tool.
- `ui.js` shows a time picker for `format: "time"` fields and option labels from
  `x-ui.enumLabels`. It groups radio buttons under a legend and links each field to its
  description for screen readers.
- `action-transport.js` opens the confirmation dialog with focus on its heading, so a
  stray Enter cannot confirm an action. Closing the dialog puts focus back where it was.
- `index.js` tells visitors that only actions that cannot be undone ask first, when the
  site offers `website_*` tools.

Protocol name: `nsdeploy`. Use it for `<protocol_name>` in `agent-manifest.json`. It
names the discovery files, such as `.well-known/nsdeploy.json`, that nsdeploy's tools read.

Do not edit or replace these files for one site. This copy is for use until nsdeploy's
own runtime offers these tools.

nsdeploy plans to move to a runtime built on the neuro-san TS package (nsdeploy PR #10).
That runtime has no `website_*` tools yet. Before a site switches to it, move the edits
above to it and check that it offers those tools.
